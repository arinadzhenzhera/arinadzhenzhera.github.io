                        I went to English Camp for the first time when I was 11.
                        There, I found my first ever friends, and experienced
                        acceptance and love. I found a family that I never knew
                        I needed, and I decided to stay there. I started going
                        there every summer, and, by the time I was 15, I knew
                        for sure I wanted to work there. That was when I joined
                        the Student Pedagogical Brigade “Student Training
                        English Program.” The training was a year long. We
                        studied not only basic theory of child psychology, but
                        also medicine, game technology, and conflict resolution
                        techniques. Having passed all the exams, I finally
                        turned 16 and started working.

                        After working for a year, I had to take a break because
                        I moved to a different country. Next summer I came back
                        to the camp, and, when I had to leave, I knew for sure I
                        have to start my own team and teach people myself. Join
                        me! Together we can change the world by giving love to
                        one heart at a time.
